# US Accidents 2019 - Predicting Accident Severity Model

Using Moosavi, Sobhan, Mohammad Hossein Samavatian, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, and Rajiv Ramnath. “A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset.”, 2019, 
the goal is to create a Model where we predict the Severity of such accidents. Such Model could help reduce accidents and create better driver safety by predicting what key factors weight in that provoke such accidents. The model would obviously help do better financial investments and allocate human resources in a proper way to create a safer conditions for drivers. 

#### Dataset Overview
US-Accident dataset is a countrywide car accident dataset. It contains more than 7 million cases of traffic accidents that took place from February 2016 to December 2020. For this project it was only took in account all 20xx Data reported by Bing / MapQuest after our EDA and for Modeling, so that irrelevant can be eliminated for the greatest extent of it.
